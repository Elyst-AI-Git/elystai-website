-- 0008_enrollment_overview_view.sql
-- Nihal reported that browsing app.enrollments in Supabase Studio shows only
-- IDs (profile_id, batch_id) — no name/email/phone, which live on
-- public.profiles. Getting that info today means manually joining three
-- tables by hand in the SQL editor every time.
--
-- This view does that join once, read-only, so Table Editor → Views shows a
-- single human-readable row per enrollment: who they are, what they signed up
-- for, whether they paid, and what they said in onboarding.
--
-- Deliberately NOT granted to anon/authenticated — this is for the team
-- browsing via Supabase Studio (which connects as postgres, bypassing RLS
-- entirely), not for the app to query. No new access is opened up.
